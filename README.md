# EnergyUCB-Bandit
The official EnergyUCB implementation for the paper "Online Energy Optimization in GPUs: A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach".

## Contributions
• Problem Formulation: We formally define the **new problem of online GPU energy optimization** and formulate it as a **multi-armed bandit framework**, which inherently addresses the exploration \& exploitation dilemma across frequencies in the online setting. <br/>
• Algorithm: We develop a principled **multi-armed bandit framework EnergyUCB** that evaluates GPU performance in real-time using the ratio of GPU core utilization to uncore utilization. The reward formulation is designed to **balance the performance-energy trade-off** by considering both energy consumption and performance. <br/>
• Evaluation: We **collect a dataset from PVC GPUs installed in the Aurora supercomputer, the second-fastest supercomputer in the world**. Using this dataset, we evaluate our proposed EnergyUCB framework on various real-world HPC applications. **The experimental results demonstrate that EnergyUCB can achieve energy savings for Aurora compared to its default settings**. <br/>

## Getting Started
### Environment
* python             3.10.14
* numpy              1.26.4
* pandas             2.2.2

### Run
Run the EnergyUCB.py with the following command in a terminal:

`python EnergyUCB.py --app app`

Replace app with the name of HPC application.

For exmaple, if we want to optimize emnergy in GPUs for the HPC application 532.sph_exa_t, the command should be as follows:

`python EnergyUCB.py --app 532.sph_exa_t`
